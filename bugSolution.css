Instead of relying on a percentage that's computed from the wrong dimension, use viewport height units (`vh`) or explicitly calculate the height based on the element's parent container or width.  For example, if you need the height to be 50% of the width plus 20 pixels, calculate the width first using JavaScript and then apply the height accordingly.  Alternatively, if the height should be relative to the viewport, use `vh` units.
